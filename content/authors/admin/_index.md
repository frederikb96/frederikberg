I am an Alumni of the Chair for Embedded Software at RWTH Aachen University. My research was about the safety of embedded medical devices. However, I decided to leave my PhD position since the position did not offer what I wanted to get out of it, though I am still highly interested in research. I use this gap semester to upskill in Information Security and AI Safety. Moreover, I am also currently engaged in some projects I always wanted to find time for.

For a few years, I have been working on projects like Linux servers including Nextcloud and network/backup solutions. I am also interested in knowledge management, as well as organizing and structuring data. On the sport side, I like bouldering and being in nature, bicycling and hiking. Furthermore, I enjoy working on the refurbishment of old bicycles.
