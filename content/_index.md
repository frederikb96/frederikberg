I created this page as an entry point to my projects and my Wiki:
- In my [Wiki](https://wiki.bergrunde.net), you can find information about my home servers and other technical knowledge, I've written down, so I don't forget it ;)
- Other interesting projects are available via [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/frederikb96) (I switched from GitHub to GitLab in 2022). Here is a small selection of some projects:
	- [Nextcloud-MvSharedPics App](https://gitlab.com/frederikb96/nextcloud-mvsharedpics): This is a small Nextcloud server app, I developed to move shared pictures automatically.
	- [Matrix-Notifications-Spaces-Scheduler](https://gitlab.com/frederikb96/matrix-notifications-spaces-scheduler): This python script allows to automatically change notification profiles of a Matrix account.
	- [Linux-Scripts](https://gitlab.com/frederikb96/Linux-Scripts): A repository containing many of my self-written general-purpose Linux scripts and information about my backup strategies.
	- [music-split-merge](https://gitlab.com/frederikb96/music-split-merge): This repository contains python scripts for manipulate old-school mp3 files.
